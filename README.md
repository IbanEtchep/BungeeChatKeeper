# BungeeChatKeeper

Since the 1.20.2 update of Minecraft, the chat is cleared on the client side with each server change within a BungeeCord network. To address this issue, this plugin records the player's chat and sends it back to them once they connect to a new server.

### **Depends on [Protocolize](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocolize-protocollib-for-bungeecord-waterfall-velocity.63778/)**

### Installation:
- Download BungeeChatKeeper and Protocolize
- Drop plugins on your bungeecord plugins folder
- Restart your server
